Little Compton is a hidden treasure as it's hidden beauty and boutique style has always appealed to full-time and part-time Little Compton residence. Juice Inc. was meant as a contribution to Little Compton and It's beauty.\r\n\r\n## Why Juice?\r\nSmoothies and Juice has always been a big part of my families lifestyle as we are always tinkering with intriguing flavors and odd ingredients. \r\n\r\n## Where Juice? \r\nJuice Inc. is located right by Walkers, the local farmstand. We will keep you posted if our location changes right on the site!\r\n\r\n## When Juice?\r\nMon - Fri = 12:45am to 6pm\r\nSat - Sun = 9am to 6pm ",
